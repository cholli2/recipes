Great Chocolate Chip Cookies 
from David Lebovitz's Great Book of Chocolate

 1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar
 1/2 cup (120 grams) firmly packed light brown sugar
 8 tablespoons (1 stick) (115 grams) unsalted butter, cold, cut into 1/2-inch (1cm) pieces
 1 large egg
 1 teaspoon vanilla extract
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda
 1 1/4 cups (175 grams) all-purpose flour
 1/4 teaspoon salt
 1 1/2 cups (200 grams) semisweet chocolate chips
 1 cup(130 grams) walnuts or pecans, toasted and chopped

Adjust the oven rack to the top 1/3 of the oven and preheat to 300F (150C). Line three baking sheets
with parchment paper.

Beat the sugars and butters together until smooth. Mix in the egg, vanilla, and baking soda. Stir
together the flour and salt, then mix them into the batter. Mix in the chocolate chips and nuts.

Scoop the cookie dough into 2-tablespoon (5cm) balls and place 8 balls, spaced 4 inches (10cm)
apart, on each of the baking sheets.

Bake for 18 minutes, or until pale golden brown. Remove from the oven and cool on a wire rack.

Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days.

Make about 20 cookies.
